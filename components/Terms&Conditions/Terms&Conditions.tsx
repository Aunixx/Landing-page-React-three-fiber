            <h3>5. Risks of nitro tokens and limitations of liabilities</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>5.1.</strong> You understand and acknowledge that nitro
              tokens, blockchain-based technologies and other associated and
              related technologies are not exclusively (or, as appropriate, at
              all) controlled by the company and adverse changes in market
              forces or the technology, broadly construed, may prevent or
              compromise the company’s performance under these terms. As such,
              the purchase of nitro tokens carries with it a number of risks.
              Prior to purchasing nitro tokens, you should carefully consider
              the risks listed herein and, to the extent necessary, consult an
              appropriate lawyer, accountant, or tax professional. If any of the
              risks associated with purchasing and holding of nitro tokens is
              unacceptable to you, you should not purchase nitro tokens.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.2.</strong> The nitro tokens will be issued on the
              ethereum chain [subject to change]. As such, any malfunction or
              unexpected functioning of the ethereum or the other applicable
              protocol may impact your ability to transfer or securely hold the
              nitro tokens. Any blockchain may be subject to malicious hacks or
              viruses. Such impact could adversely affect the value of the nitro
              tokens.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.3.</strong> You acknowledge and understand that the
              nitro tokens may be migrated from the ethereum chain to a
              different base-layer blockchain. The process of transitioning the
              nitro tokens may not be error free and may have unintended
              consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.4.</strong> The company is subject to all of the
              business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business,
              including the risk that the company will not achieve its
              technological or operational objectives, which could result in a
              substantial decline in the value of your investment and/or the
              utility of the nitro tokens. Before deciding to purchase the nitro
              tokens, you should consider the risks and difficulties frequently
              encountered by early-stage companies that are similar to the
              company and operate in new and rapidly evolving markets,
              particularly those companies whose businesses depend upon
              developing new technologies and that rely on the internet and
              blockchain-based technology. These difficulties include, among
              others, the ability to (i) generate or increase revenues and
              manage costs; (ii) increase awareness of the company; (iii) offer
              compelling products or demonstrate utility; (iv) secure adoption
              and/or market saturation; (v) maintain current and develop new
              strategic relationships; (vi) respond effectively to competitive
              pressures; (vii) develop and upgrade technology; (viii) attract,
              retain and motivate qualified personnel; and (ix) raise additional
              capital. The company cannot assure you that its strategy will
              overcome any or all of these obstacles. In addition, you should
              take into consideration that the initial and only material assets
              of the company will be the proceeds from the sale (whether through
              private sale or through the nitro token sale) and the company ip.
              It is possible that the funds generated from the offering will be
              insufficient (particularly given the volatility of cryptocurrency
              value) to adequately develop the necessary technology for the
              company and/or third party service providers to continue operating
              the platform or for the company to operate its business. This may
              prevent you from accessing or using one or more intended or
              implied functions of your nitro tokens and adversely impact the
              value and/or utility of your nitro tokens. Further, if the company
              is unable to adequately develop, deploy, implement and/or market
              its technology, its risk of bankruptcy or insolvency (with the
              attendant risks for you) is higher than that of more established
              companies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.5.</strong> The company may be subjected to a variety of
              cyberattacks from time to time. Such attacks could result in the
              disruption of hardware and software systems, loss, misuse,
              misappropriation and corruption of data and information, including
              proprietary information or personal data, interruption of seller
              operations, and lost competitive advantages, any of which could
              have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and
              ability to meet its strategic, operational and technological
              objectives. Any breach of data security that exposes or
              compromises the security of the company, the platform and its
              assets, including any private digital keys linked to funds
              generated through this offering could result in significant losses
              that materially impair the company’s ability to operate on a
              go-forward basis and adversely impact the value and utility of the
              nitro tokens.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.6.</strong> Information that you store or transfer
              through the platform may become irretrievably lost or corrupted or
              temporarily unavailable due to a variety of causes, including
              software failures, protocol changes by third party providers,
              internet outages, force majeure events, or other disasters,
              including third party distributed denial of services attacks,
              scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, or other causes either
              within or outside of the company’s control. The performance of the
              company is subject to the following uncertainties, among others:

              <li>

              <li>Hacking and theft of cryptocurrencies and tokens;</li>
              <li>

                emergence of new cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks; and

              <li>
                Unfavourable developments in any of the above circumstances, or
                like circumstances, could adversely affect the company’s
                business and the value or utility of the nitro token.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>5.7.</strong> It is possible that due to a number of
              reasons outside of the company’s control, including but not
              limited to, changes in regulatory or intellectual property law,
              technological advancements, decreases in token or cryptocurrency
              or cryptographic token utility, social or economic reforms, the
              failure of commercial relationships, or the malfunction, breakdown
              or abandonment of the protocol, the company, blockchain-based
              technology and other related technologies may dissolve, disappear,
              be abandoned or otherwise no longer operate, or operate with
              material impairments.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.8.</strong> The market value of cryptocurrencies (and,
              therefore, the potential market value of nitro tokens) may go up
              or down, and the market value of cryptocurrencies have
              demonstrated extreme volatility. Any cryptographic tokens may not
              have market value. You should expect fluctuations, both down and
              up, in the market value (if any) of nitro tokens that you
              purchase, if any, and such fluctuations may be extremely volatile,
              including price crashes (including to zero value) that may occur
              in the event of political or economic crises that cause a
              large-scale sell-off of nitro tokens. In addition, there may not
              be a market for resale of nitro tokens or exchanging nitro tokens
              for fiat currencies, and the company cannot and does not guarantee
              market liquidity for nitro tokens or the ability to exchange nitro
              tokens for fiat currencies by purchasers of nitro tokens. In the
              event that the nitro tokens are listed on an exchange or may be
              transferred through other means in accordance with applicable law,
              the potential market value of the nitro tokens may be subject to
              drastic fluctuations and extreme volatility. Therefore, the price
              at which you purchase the nitro tokens may not represent an
              accurate valuation of the nitro tokens. Further, there is no
              guarantee of market liquidity for the nitro tokens or the ability
              to exchange the nitro tokens for equal value in fiat currency. If
              the nitro tokens are permitted to be bought, sold, or transferred
              in accordance with applicable law, several factors may cause a
              decrease in the price and value of your nitro tokens, including,
              but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Global cryptocurrency supply;</li>
              <li>
                Global cryptocurrency demand, which can be influenced by the
                growth of retail merchants’ and commercial businesses’
                acceptance of cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and
                services, the security of online cryptocurrency exchanges and
                digital wallets that hold cryptocurrencies, the perception that
                the use and holding of cryptocurrencies is safe and secure, and
                the regulatory restrictions on their use;
              </li>
              <li>
                Any software “fork” initiated by third party groups or
                individuals involved in blockchains related to cryptocurrencies
                to create a new version of such cryptocurrencies, which may
                alter the economics of the cryptocurrencies and affect the value
                of the cryptocurrencies in the market;
              </li>
              <li>

                inflation;

            <p>
              <strong>5.9.</strong> The nitro tokens are a new issue of
              cryptographic tokens for which there is no established public
              market, and an active trading market may not develop. Although the
              company hopes eventually to list the nitro tokens on a
              cryptocurrency exchange, there can be no assurance that such
              exchanges will accept the nitro tokens for listing or maintain the
              listing if it is accepted. There also can be no assurance that a
              secondary market will develop or, if a secondary market does
              develop, that it will be a liquid market or that it will continue
              for the life of the nitro tokens. The liquidity of any market for
              the nitro tokens will depend on a number of factors, including:
              (i) the number of holders of nitro tokens; (ii) the company’s
              performance and financial condition; (iii) the development and
              performance of the platform; (iv) the market for similar
              cryptographic tokens; (v) the interest of traders in making a
              market for the nitro tokens; (vi) the interest of financial
              institutions and other enterprises in utilizing the nitro token;
              (vii) regulatory developments in the cryptographic token or
              cryptocurrency industries and (viii) legal restrictions on
              transferring or selling the nitro tokens. The cryptographic token
              market is a new and rapidly developing market which may be subject
              to substantial and unpredictable disruptions that cause
              significant volatility in the prices of cryptographic tokens.
              There can be no assurance that the market, if any, for the nitro
              tokens will be free from such disruptions or that any such
              disruptions may not adversely affect your ability to sell your
              nitro tokens. Therefore, there is no assurance that you will be
              able to sell your nitro tokens at a particular time, or that the
              price received upon a sale, if any, will be favorable.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.10.</strong> Because of the differences between the
              nitro token and traditional investment securities, there is a risk
              that issues that might easily be resolved under existing laws if
              traditional securities were involved may not be easily resolved
              for the nitro token. For example, there is little precedent on how
              existing law might treat the issue, fungibility, settlement
              finality, transfer, collateralization, sequestration, loan,
              hypothecation, redemption or other disposition of nitro tokens.
              There is also little precedent on how existing laws might treat
              the rights and obligations between and among the company, nitro
              token purchasers, and ultimate holders of nitro tokens. The
              occurrence of any related issue or dispute could have a material
              adverse effect on the company’s business or the nitro token. New
              developments in law may also adversely affect the treatment of the
              nitro token or the company’s business.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.11.</strong> The regulatory landscape with respect to
              cryptocurrencies and cryptographic tokens, including nitro tokens,
              is fast evolving. There may be uncertainty in the regulatory
              treatment of nitro tokens and the nitro token sale in
              jurisdictions where the nitro token sale is conducted. Although
              the company does not believe that nitro tokens are securities in
              any jurisdiction where the nitro token sale is conducted, there is
              no assurance that relevant competent government or regulatory
              authorities (“relevant authorities”) would take a similar view,
              either now or in the future. Similarly, although the company does
              not believe that the offer, purchase and sale of nitro tokens are
              subject to any securities, commodities, derivatives or other
              financial law and regulation (collectively, "regulations”), there
              is no guarantee that the relevant authorities may not subsequently
              determine that the nitro token sale is subject to regulation and
              is or was not in compliance with certain regulations. Any such
              different view or determination by relevant authorities may
              adversely affect the legality of the nitro token sale or impose
              restrictions on the transfer of nitro tokens and other regulatory
              requirements, which may affect the market value and liquidity of
              nitro tokens.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.12.</strong> As blockchain networks and blockchain
              assets have grown in popularity and in market size, government
              agencies and regulatory authorities have begun to take interest
              in, and in some cases regulate, their use and operation.
              Jurisdictions, such as, but not limited to, the european union,
              the people’s republic of china, south korea, india and japan, are
              currently considering, or may in the future consider, laws,
              guidance or other actions, which may severely impact the utility
              of the nitro tokens, and the interoperability of blockchain-based
              protocols generally.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.13.</strong> Unlike certain accounts with financial
              institutions, nitro tokens are not insured by any governmental or
              regulatory entity. In the event of loss, or the loss of utility
              value, you may not have recourse (and shall never have recourse
              against the company in accordance with these terms) unless you
              obtain private insurance for your nitro tokens at your own cost.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.14.</strong> Nitro tokens are irredeemable, and except
              as provided in clause 4.7 above, or otherwise set forth in these
              terms, you will not have the right to any refund or exchange or
              otherwise force the company to redeem your nitro tokens for any
              value (monetary or in- kind).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.15.</strong> In making a decision to participate in this
              offering, it is your obligation to consult your own tax advisors
              regarding tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership
              and sale or disposition of the nitro tokens, including, for
              example, sales, use and value added taxes, as well as income and
              withholding taxes. In addition, you are responsible to withhold,
              collect, report and remit any taxes that apply to the purchase of
              the nitro tokens and remit such taxes to the appropriate taxing
              authorities. You are also responsible for reviewing all current
              and future tax considerations that may be relevant to you in
              connection with purchasing the nitro token with your own tax
              advisers. You may experience adverse enforcement or other
              consequences in connection with purchasing nitro tokens.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.16.</strong> Upon a liquidation, bankruptcy or other
              dissolution of the company, you will not be entitled to
              liquidation rights under any insolvency or bankruptcy applicable
              law.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.17.</strong> Unless otherwise determined by the company,
              you, by holding nitro tokens, are not entitled to voting rights or
              other management or control rights in or with respect to the
              company. Accordingly, until such time that the company shall
              determine otherwise, the company will control in its sole
              discretion all decisions and actions of the company, including
              with respect to the platform and the company’s operations,
              affiliations, corporate activities and investments. Further, any
              and/or all decisions made by the company’s executive team may
              conflict with your interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.18.</strong> The company will devote such time as they
              deem reasonably necessary to conduct the business affairs of the
              company in an appropriate manner. However, it is possible that the
              company may not meet its objectives or milestones and the value
              and utility of the nitro token may be negatively affected.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.19.</strong> The success of the company is expected to
              be significantly dependent upon the expertise and efforts of the
              company’s executive team. The loss of any of these key individuals
              could have a significant adverse impact on the company’s
              operations, ability to develop, deploy, and implement the platform
              or meet its objectives and milestones. No assurances can be given
              that such key individuals will continue to be affiliated with the
              company. Notwithstanding any prior experience that key individuals
              may have in developing new technologies that are expected to be
              created by the company, any such experience necessarily was
              obtained under different market conditions and with different
              technologies at the forefront of development. There can be no
              assurance that the key individuals will be able to duplicate prior
              levels of success.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.20.</strong> It is possible that alternative networks or
              platforms could be created that utilize the same or similar
              open-source codes and protocols that underline the nitro tokens.
              Competition from such networks, or platforms, start-ups,
              established technology companies, academia, open-source efforts,
              and financial institutions could negatively impact the performance
              of the group, the platform and/or the value of nitro tokens. Some
              of the company’s current and potential competitors have
              significantly greater resources and better competitive positions
              in certain markets than the company. These factors may allow such
              competitors to respond more effectively than the company to new or
              emerging technologies and changes in market requirements. The
              manner and degree of competition varies greatly and competition
              may adversely impact, among other things, the company’s ability to
              operationalize its business, develop or implement the platform,
              create relationships with exchanges and increase adoption of the
              platform with various connectors. In turn, if the company is
              unable to successfully mitigate, or compete with, these
              competitive forces, the value and utility of the nitro tokens may
              be negatively impacted.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.21.</strong> It is possible that the platform will not
              be used by a large number of individuals and other entities and
              that there will be limited public interest in the platform or
              distributed ecosystems more generally. Such a lack of interest
              could negatively impact the development of the platform and
              services and their potential use. Therefore, the success of the
              platform and services it provides cannot be predicted.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.22.</strong> The platform may undergo significant
              changes from time to time, including changes in the design and
              implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the
              platform. Further, the group may be unable, despite its good faith
              efforts, to adequately finance the creation, deployment,
              maintenance and/or operation of the platform, which may adversely
              impact the value and utility of nitro tokens.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.23.</strong> It is possible that, despite the group’s
              good faith efforts to develop and maintain the platform, the
              platform may experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be
              adequately developed or maintained, which may individually or
              collectively negatively impact the platform and the value of nitro
              tokens. Despite the group’s good faith efforts to exclude any
              viruses from the platform and secure the network and technologies
              interacting with the platform, it is possible that one or more
              third-parties can or will introduce malicious code or other
              viruses into the open-source software and code underlying the
              platform and/or create, undercover or exploit weaknesses in the
              security of the cloud-based services used in connection with the
              operation of the platform. Such events may impact the continued
              development, deployment or operation of the platform and/or the
              value of nitro tokens.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5.24.</strong> There are risks associated with using or

              purchased, including the risks of retroactive regulatory
              applicability. The company aims to be made aware of material and
              relevant changes to applicable law and regulation in the most
              relevant jurisdictions in the world and shall act accordingly in
              the event changes to applicable law and regulation impact

              financial services, such as investment services, fund management
              or investment advice. The nitro token sale is not a public
              offering of equity, debt or units in a collective investment
              scheme and consequently does not fall under the securities or any

              you. If you do not maintain an accurate record of the password,
              this may lead to the loss of your tokens. If your password

              <strong>12.7.</strong> Tax issues. The company makes no
              representations concerning the tax implications of the sale of
              nitro tokens or the possession or use of them. You bear the sole
              responsibility to determine if the purchase of nitro tokens with
              cryptocurrency or the potential appreciation or depreciation in
              the value of nitro tokens over time has tax implications for you
              in your home jurisdiction. By purchasing nitro tokens, and to the
              extent permitted by law, you agree to be solely responsible for
              any applicable taxes imposed on, and agree not to hold the company
              liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from your
              purchase, possession, or transfer of nitro tokens. All fees and
              charges payable by you to the company are exclusive of any taxes,
              and shall certain taxes be applicable, they shall be added on top
              of the payable amounts. Upon the company’s request, you will
              provide it any information it reasonably requests to determine
              whether it is obligated to collect vat from you, including your
              vat identification number. If any deduction or withholding is
              required by applicable law, you will notify the company and will
              pay the company any additional amounts necessary to ensure that
              the net amount that the company receives, after any deduction and
              withholding, equals the amount the company would have received if
              no deduction or withholding had been required. Additionally, you
              will provide the company with documentation showing that the
              withheld and deducted amounts have been paid to the relevant
              taxing authority. To the extent the company is responsible for
              remitting any withholding taxes or value added or similar taxes,
              your allocation of nitro tokens shall be reduced to the extent
              such taxes are required to be remitted by the company. The company
              wishes to make you aware that future use of the nitro tokens by
              you when transacting with the company may result in withholding
              taxes, value added tax and/or similar taxes being imposed. You
              will be responsible for such taxes, however, where the company is
              responsible for remitting taxes, the amount of taxes shall be
              deducted from the fees otherwise due and payable by you in
              connection with your transactions with the company.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>12.8.</strong> Force majeure events. The company shall not
              be liable for (i) any inaccuracy, error, delay in, or omission of
              (a) any information, or (b) the transmission or delivery of
              information; (ii) any loss or damage arising from any event beyond
              the company’s reasonable control, including but not limited to
              flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other acts
              of god, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident,
